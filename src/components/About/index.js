      <p> Hello! <br />
            Welcome to my portfolio. I am currently enrolled in a coding
            bootcamp through Michigan State University to advance my career.
            <br />
            Along with coding, I enjoy being outdoors, exploring new places and
            meeting new people. <br />
            Please reach out if you have any questions on my work. <br />
            Thank you!</p>
